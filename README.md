# Sample Synthetic Populations

This repository contains definitions for sample synthetic populations which can be produced by [Syntheaâ„¢](https://github.com/synthetichealth/synthea)

## Instructions
*These instructions assume you already have an up-to-date version of Synthea and all prerequisites installed and ready to run, and use `run_synthea` as the base command to run*
1. Download `module_overrides.properties` from a subfolder of this project to your local system
2. Switch Synthea to the `module_overrides` branch (required until this PR is merged: https://github.com/synthetichealth/synthea/pull/566 )
3. Run Synthea, specifying the downloaded `module_overrides.properties` as well as any other desired options:
```shell
> ./run_synthea --module_override=(path_to_module_overrides.properties)
```

For example, to generate 1,000 patients within the state of New York :

```shell
> ./run_synthea -p 1000 --module_override=(path_to_module_overrides.properties) "New York"

```
